# Eat-da-burger

## Overview

In this assignment, for the University of Washington Coding Boot Camp, I created a burger logger with MySql, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. It uses Node and MySQL to query and route date to the app and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Installation

To run the application locally, clone this repository with the following command.

	git clone git@github.com:NathanSaunders/Burger.git
	
Next, install the application dependencies.

	cd Burger
	npm install
	
Finally, run the node server locally.

	node start
	
Now, open the local application on port 8080 at the URL: `http://localhost:8080/`.
